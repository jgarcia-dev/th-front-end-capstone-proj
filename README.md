# Treehouse Front End Capstone Project
Final project for the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree.

The project consists of a personal portfolio page that showcases some of the projects I completed as part of the Treehouse Front End Web Development Techdegree program.

The portfolio site uses a mobile-first responsive design. JavaScript was used for mobile navigation as well as to auto-generate the project cards from a data array.
